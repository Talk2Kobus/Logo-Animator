## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

This project is designed to run in a browser-based environment with ES Modules and does not require a traditional build step (like Vite or Webpack).

**Prerequisites:**
-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-   A Google Cloud project with billing enabled to use the Veo video generation model.

**Running the Application:**
1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/logo-animator-studio.git
    cd logo-animator-studio
    ```
2.  **Set up the API Key:**
    The application is designed to work with an injected `process.env.API_KEY`. In development environments where this is not available, you can simulate it or use a tool that provides this, like the AI Studio environment. For local development outside of such an environment, you may need to use a simple local server and manually manage your key.

3.  **Serve the files:**
    You can use a simple local web server to run the project. The `live-server` VS Code extension or a simple Python server works well.
    ```bash
    # Using Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
4.  **Open in browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port provided by your server).
